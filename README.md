## Hi there, Nice to see you.

I'm Furkan from Türkiye. I'm studying computer engineering at Selçuk University. Besides traveling, exploring, and creating, I also love coffee, sports, and most of all, cats. In my free time, I like to research and learn new things, create projects to improve myself, and I also play basketball and volleyball. I love playing and making games a lot. So, I've participated in gam jams several times. I've developed games and websites numerous times. I've also worked on various freelance design projects in my spare time. In 2021, I formed my own team (community) of around 20 people. We created 2D cartoons, animations, video content, and games. We developed in-game content and levels for a game that has over 100 million downloads on the Play Store. With the team's disbandment, we put our work on hold. Later, when this recession passed, I re-entered the gaming industry with another team. And now, we've created our own game development and game jam community. We plan to develop games with people who have great ideas. We also share game jam events with each other and join those events who are interested and available. Currently, 5 or 6 of us are developing another game and we're even more ambitious this time because we want to develop the gaming industry in Türkiye and make our name known globally. The estimated release date is 2026, during the Steam Spring or Summer sales. Stay tuned. Now that you've met me, you can find more information about my interests and work below. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please contact me via email.
